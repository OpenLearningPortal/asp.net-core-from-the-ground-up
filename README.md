# ASP.NET CORE FROM THE GROUND UP

Welcome to the book ASP.NET CORE FROM THE GROUND UP .If you are reading this,chances are that you would like to learn a thing or two about asp.net core. I decided to write this because I wanted to solidify my own knowledge of ASP.NET CORE and I thought I could help people new to ASP.NET CORE learn it from my perspective. There are quite a few tutorials on asp.net core floating around on the internet.Official documentation [https:\/\/docs.asp.net\/en\/latest\/](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/) is a good starting point.But When I was starting out in asp.net core, I didn't learn from just one resource. So this is an attempt at adding another useful resource for learning asp.net core ,hope you like it.
